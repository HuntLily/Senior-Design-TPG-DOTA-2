Dota 2 Weekly report
4/6/2020

Meeting start at 6:55pm

Started by discussing our current status and goals for the project. 

Going through the trainer.py class that we left off on last time. We finished by 7:45pm, and went on to reading through the Readme.txt files
to help us understand what to *do* with the files now that we knew what they *did*.

Reading through the Readme files helped us understand a little more. We used some of the code and imported some of their files to our Agent.

Our goals for next time are to read through the examples given to us so we know which methods to call in our own Agent.py. We also
mean to find where the files store their save data. 

Gameplan going forward:
* find methods in /tpg folder that are necessary for the Agent to perform
* import these methods to our Agent.py file so that it can perform these actions
* run our Agent in Dota 2 where it will save the data from its runs to somewhere, and over time improve its performance
* if we notice that the agent is learning slowly or learning the wrong things, we can adjust the parameters of the methods
we called in our Agent.py to change the learning behavior of the AI.
