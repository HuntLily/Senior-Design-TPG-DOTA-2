weekly meeting April 29th, 2020

Meeting start at 5pm

Due to having a lot of work in other classes (namely Software Engineering) we elected to focus elsewhere for the first half of this week,
and focus on this project for the back half of the week. 

Our goals for this week are to find where the Agent's memories are stored, and create documentation for our project for both the 
Senior Design Project as well as the GECCO Competition.
