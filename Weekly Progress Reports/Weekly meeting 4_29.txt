weekly meeting April 29th, 2020

Meeting start at 5pm

Due to having a lot of work in other classes (namely Software Engineering) we elected to focus elsewhere for the first half of this week,
and focus on this project for the back half of the week. 

Our goals for this week are to find where the Agent's memories are stored, and create documentation for our project for both the 
Senior Design Project as well as the GECCO Competition. 

For the paper, it needs to be a few pages long describing the project, what we did, what we learned, etc.

For today, we should figure out the memories question (finally), make any last-minute adjustments, and create the paper. We will have a
team meeting on Friday where we will have the AI running in the background while we work on the paper.

As the AI runs, we should record statistics showing its growth over the course of multiple games/sessions.
