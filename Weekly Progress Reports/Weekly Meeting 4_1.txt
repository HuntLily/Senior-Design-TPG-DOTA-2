Dota II TPG Group Meeting
4/1/2020



Meeting start at 4:15pm

We spent the first 20 minutes catching up and opening files and such, finding our feet and such. We decided that the first logical step 
was to find the python files we’d be using and read through them to understand them.


It took a short amount of time to find the files we’d talked about last time, but we found them in the PyTPG folder. We opened them 
up in IntelliJ using the Python addon 'PyCharm' (Christian had installed it before-hand, the rest of us will download it on our own time). 


There were 6 files to read through (agent, learner, program, team, trainer, and utils.py) and we started with agent. 


We spend about an hour just going through the files ‘agent.py’, ‘learner.py’, ‘program.py’, 'utils', and part of ‘team.py’

In the 'learner' file, which controls the evolution of the AI, we came accross the Mutate function, which is what what actually drives the
learning/evolution in the AI. It was, unsurprisingly, very complex. We decided that, since it is unlikely that we will have to modify it 
for ourselves that we could come back to it once we'd understood more (hopefully).

At the start of 'program.py' there are a trio of attributes that we did not fully understand either. They seemed to deal with the storage
or memory of the AI. ALso in 'program.py' in the very large Execute method, we found code that suggested that improvements ought to be made
to make the method more flexible with different variables (the section had many constants that could be replaced with variables).


Next time, when we go through trainer.py, we're going to have either a document, or paint or something for a visual representation
of each class, its methods, and the associated variables for each, so we know what is referencing what, and can get a (hopefully) clearer
picture of the TPG as a whole rather than just its parts.
