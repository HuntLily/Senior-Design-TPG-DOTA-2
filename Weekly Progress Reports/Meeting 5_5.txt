Currently, we are struggling to implement the file saving system. Our unfamiliarity with the python language is hampering
our abilities somewhat. 

Quick recap, our goals to be completed before Monday:
* store itself and be packageable
* it must be able to win consistently
* Alternatively, show improvement
* write up a report on the project

What do we need to accomplish in order to achieve the file saving system
* We need to be able to save a file and load it in python
* We then need to be able to save *our* file and load it in python
* We need to know *what* we need to save and load (We think we've got this step already)
Did we specify an output?

What do we need to do to get the AI to show improvement
* We can start by running the random and the unedited tpg agents to give some context for how our agent is performing
	* this should be done during our meetings even when we are coding
* Getting my laptop to run the agent, even if only to test that the code we are writing is working.
* We need to test and run many, many rounds, likely a few hundred.
	* the save system would be helpful for this, although maybe not necessary
* We need to record every so many games for all 3 agents to show the progress.
