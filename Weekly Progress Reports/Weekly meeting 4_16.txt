The weekly meeting this week had to be rescheduled due to exams in our other classes. 

Meeting began at 12:40pm

Our goals for this meeting as set last week: copy the code we said we'd copy, and find the indices for the state[] array so we can use
that to make our own fitness function

Began by copying over the code we said we would copy last week, and marking the code we said we'd change. 

Scheduled an extra meeting for Friday at noon

Held our meeting with Professor Zhao at 1pm, and finished at 1:20pm. We got back to our meeting right after.

We began looking for the state[] array, by modifying the code to print off all of the states once the game is over. We were unable to find
it this way though, and asked the organizers if they had further documentation.

They directed us to the swagger file, where we found it immediately.

We went through the 309 indices of state[], and pared it down to the most basic actions we needed rewards for. One of these was 'kills',
that is, rewarding the AI for getting a kill on the enemy team. This is not one of the lited state[] indices, so we plan on using the 
'radiantkills' from CompletedRun to reward the Agent once the game is complete. We can also use deaths counter from CompletedRun to 
penalize the bot as well.

However, before we went too far down that rabbit hole, we shifted our focus to making sure the Agent runs on the Breezy Server.
Currently, both our Agent, and the Agent we based our code from, do not run on the server. A different, shorter example that was given
to us *does* run on the server though, so we are comparing the two.

We started by moving our Agent to the folder with the tpg. We encountered a *new* error, which was some nice progress.

We left off on the new error. Currently numpy was not being found. 

Tomorrow we'll pick up here. Our goal is to get our agent running on the server, and if we have time, to build our rough draft of a fitness
function.
