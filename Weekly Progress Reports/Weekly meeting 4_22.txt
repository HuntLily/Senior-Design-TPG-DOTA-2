weekly meeting April 22th, 2020

Meeting start at 6:15pm

Today, we'll put some small touches on the fitness function that we didn't get to last time (kills and deaths specifically), as well as
some house keeping. We're going to be going through our rather messy folders and cleaning out files we don't need, duplicates that were
made, and organizing them so that files we need are easier to find.

The other major goal for us right now is to find where the Agent's learning is stored, and what files specifically we'll be submitting
at the end of the competition. Are we submitting them an Agent that has already learned, or will they be taking our agent file we've
designed and train it themselves? We asked the organizers.

He got back to us saying we will submit a short paper (1-2 pages) and an agent package that includes your agent files.

In the meantime, we went ahead and added the kills and deaths to the fitness function.
