weekly meeting April 20th, 2020

Meeting start at 4:45pm

We're gonna try and keep this meeting fairly short since it is Ethan's girlfriend's birthday today.

When we last left off, we are pretty sure we got our Agent working in the game correctly. It was taking actions without any prompting
from us, so unless further complications arise, we believe we are ready to move on to the next and final step of the project:
designing and improving the fitness function.

Today we will start by creating a fitness function from scratch. To do this, first we listed the actions we wanted to reward/penalize.
* kills												[completed run]
* deaths											[completed run]
* last hits											[24]
* denies											[25]
* friendly tower health										[58/59]
* enemy tower health										[64/65]
* wins/losses											[completed run]
* net worth											[23]
* ai health% is higher than opp health%								[2/3 vs 32/33]
	* this should scale based on the difference between %'s
* if ai level is higher than opp level								[1 vs 31]
* if the ai wins, a bonus for winning as close to 20 mins (subject to change) as possible	[56]
	* this should also be scalar of course

at 5:15pm, we had the different states we wanted to include in the fitness function.

We also found that we have to write our own code for storing the ai as its learning.
