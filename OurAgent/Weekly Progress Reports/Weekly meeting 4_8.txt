weekly meeting 4/8/2020

Meeting start at 7:00pm

Goal meetings
* Start coding agent
* Look through their agent_server_tpg.py and compare it to agen_server_random.py to see what it's doing, so we can write our own without just copying it
* note for later: be sure to credit the team that we got this code from, since we're copying a lot of it.

Went through each line and decided which ones we want to copy, which ones we will change, and what they are/do.
Lines:
1-22: copy (imports and server connection)
23-26: copy for now (arguments, can change pop size as needed)
28: copy (passing arguments)
39-41: change (this is the fitness function, one of the things we need to make ourselves)
	-figure out what the indeces in the state[] are for the other actions to reward the bot.
	-possibly ask the organizers what the order of indeces in state[], or look for documentation outside the code
46-48: copy (http request helper)
53-59: copy (sends an action to the game for the ai to perform)
64-67: copy for now (used just for testing connection, can change or delete later)
-reading through 72-196
75-76: copy (attributes we'll need)
-reading through 78-179 (this statement runs when the game ends)
78-91: copy (setting up the attributes and methods)
94-97: copy (calling the fitness function)
100-124: copy for now, change later (webhook is for multiple games, which we can change. This will be a major part of the project)
124-129: copy (global variables)
135-137: copy (checks to see if AI is done training, a completed version)
142-145: copy (rewards the ai based on its fitness function)
148-149: copy (logs the current score the ai has earned via the ff)
151-158: copy (starts a new generation of the A.I.)
162: copy (creates the new agents for the new generation)
167-174: copy (builds url to server)
178: copy? ("sends whatever to server" might break if we don't copy, and we don't know what it does, so better copy to be safe)
	-we suspect that we may have to replace the '42' with 'getFitnessFunction', but aren't sure
	-we saw in the logs that there were other "string":number things like the 42, which we may need to find in the code and change as well
180-195: copy for now (called while game is in progress, gives features from the game for the agent. Double check to be sure its complete
and nothing needs to be added. If anything is missing or not needed, then change this segment)
197-209: copy (setting up attributes and methods)
213: change (make our own team name here)
214: copy (references the number of games to play, which we change elsewhere)
217-239: copy (declarations and stuff)
242-245: copy (updating attributes we've sent elsewhere)
248-256: copy (this sets the tpg to default values)
259-261: copy (having a log will help us troubleshoot and track our progress)
264-265: copy (this is what keeps the program running until the ai is done or crashes)

At 7:30 we took a short break to watch the AI play a few rounds to see what we'd be working with. It was cool.
