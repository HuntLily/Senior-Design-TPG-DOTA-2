Meeting began at 1:45pm

Christian worked on the project on his own for a little bit, and got some progress on where we left off.

The agent connects to the Breezy Server, but the trainer is acting up. 

Goals for today are to get the agent running in the game without errors and hopefully to have a rough draft of the fitness function.

We also set up our next meeting for Mon, 4-6pm.

At 1:55pm, we got back to work looking at the current error our Agent is generating. The error we are getting is that Trainer is not
recognized, even though we are importing the full folder.
