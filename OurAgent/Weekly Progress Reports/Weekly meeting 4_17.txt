Meeting began at 1:45pm

Christian worked on the project on his own for a little bit, and got some progress on where we left off.

The agent connects to the Breezy Server, but the trainer is acting up. 

Goals for today are to get the agent running in the game without errors and hopefully to have a rough draft of the fitness function.

We also set up our next meeting for Mon, 4-6pm.

At 1:55pm, we got back to work looking at the current error our Agent is generating. The error we are getting is that Trainer is not
recognized, even though we are importing the full folder. 

We eventually discovered it was a problem with numpy again, and after some research, we found an older version of numpy and numba to
install that didn't give errors, solving our problem.

To test, we ran a game with our Agent, and it doesn't do anything in the game. Dang. Specifically, the Agent should be choosing its 
character and skipping straight into the game, but it does not select a character or act once the game begins.

We also tested the example Agent, but it also does not do anything.

We went back to comparing our Agent to the RandomAgent example (which does work, but does not use a tpg).

Unfortunately, the RandomAgent also does nothing now. At 2:40, we re-downloaded some of their files, but this did not help either.

We contacted the organizers for help, and they gave some help, and we got the Random Agent working again. We applied the changes to our
Agent to test it as well, and it worked!

Having gotten the agent to work (although it currently just attack moves down the lane), we called the meeting there. Next meeting, we will
create a barebones fitness function and run the program several times. We will also make sure that it is saving what it learns between
sessions. We should also check with the organizers what we are handing them. Are we giving them our Agent file, or some memory of what the
agent has learned?
