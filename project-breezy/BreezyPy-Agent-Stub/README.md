# Dota 2 AI Server

Here we show a random agent, which just sends random actions to the Breezy Server, as well as a more intelligent agent, using the Tangled Program Graph (TPG) algorithm. 
You can use either of these as a starting point for your own agent.
The random agent is more bare bones and therefor easier to add on to / build off of, the TPG agent is there just to show an example of what can be done.

### Tips:
- Don't run in git bash! Lots of hours wasted there. For some reason git bash skips some of the print statements randomly. Anaconda Prompts worked well.
